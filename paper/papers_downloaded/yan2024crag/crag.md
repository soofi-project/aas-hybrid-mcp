B.5 ResultsonPubHealthandArc-Challenge
It is worth mentioning that the performance on
PubHealth based on LLaMA2-hf-7b was much
worse than others. We studied these cases and
found that LLaMA2-hf-7b is relatively weak in
instruction comprehension. Most of the cases
fail to generate True or False in such a binary-
question task, resulting in a low accuracy during
theevaluation. Thissituationsomewhathappensin
