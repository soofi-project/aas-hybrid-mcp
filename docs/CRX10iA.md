SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
This chapter explains cautions for safety usage of FANUC collaborative robot.
Robot cannot work without the end effector or peripheral equipment. By combined with the end effector
and peripheral equipment and assembling the system, robot can demonstrate works. In other words the
robot is one part of the system.
FANUC is not and does not represent itself as an expert in safety systems, safety equipment, or the
specific safety aspects of your company and/or its workplace. It is the responsibility of the owner,
employer, or user to take all necessary steps to guarantee the safety of all personnel in the workplace.
The appropriate level of safety for your application and installation can best be determined by safety
system professionals.
FANUC therefore, recommends that each customer consult with such professionals in order to provide a
safe application.
Additionally, robot system owner, it is your responsibility to arrange for the training of the operator of a
robot system to recognize and respond to known hazards associated with robot to be aware of the
recommended operating procedures. Because FANUC prepare for the professional training course of the
robot, please use it.
It is recognized that the operational characteristics of robots can be significantly different from those of
other machines and equipment.
Robots are capable of high energy movements through a large volume beyond the base of robots.
Although, robot is substitution for work at dangerous zone or harmful zone, but it may cause work-related
accident by mistake.  So perfect safety precautions for usage is required when installing it.
In order to prevent work-related accident by robot, as indicators of the steps that an employer should take
each safe standard (JIS,  ISO,  IEC) are provided, these shows the contents for during installation and
usage.
This chapter provides some hints and guidelines for the robot system safety design.
Before using the FANUC collaborative robot, be sure to read this manual to become familiar with those
contents.

2.4.2
Safety of the working person
Working person safety is the primary safety consideration. As it is very dangerous to enter the operating
area of the robot during its automatic operation, adequate safety precautions must be observed.
The following lists the general safety precautions.  Careful consideration must be made to ensure
working person safety.
(1) We obligate the Working person to take a FANUC training courses.
FANUC provides various training courses.  Contact your local FANUC representative for details.
(2) Even when the robot is stationary during operation, it is possible that the robot is still in a ready to
move state, and is waiting for a signal.  In this state, the robot is regarded as still in motion.  To
ensure working person safety, provide the system with an alarm to indicate visually or aurally that
the robot is in motion.
(3) Implement the Risk assessment, if necessary, install a safety fence with a gate so that no working
person can enter the work area without passing through the gate.  Install an interlocking device, a
safety plug, and so forth in the safety gate so that the robot is stopped as the safety gate is opened.
The controller is designed to receive this interlocking signal of the door switch. When the gate is opened and this
signal is received, the controller stops the robot (Please refer to  "STOP TYPE OF ROBOT" in SAFETY
PRECAUTIONS  for detail of stop type).  For connection, refer to below  Fig. 2.4.2 (b).
(4) Provide the peripheral devices with appropriate grounding (Class A, Class B, Class C, and Class D).
(5) Recommend to install the peripheral device outside of the work area.
(6) Draw an outline on the floor, clearly indicating the range of the robot motion, including the tools
such as a hand.
(7) Implement the Risk assessment, if necessary, install a mat switch or photoelectric switch on the floor
with an interlock to a visual or aural alarm that issues alarm with light, buzzer, or stops the robot
when a working person enters the work area.
(8) If necessary, install a safety lock so that no one except the working person in charge can turn the
power on the robot controller.
The circuit breaker installed in the controller is designed to disable anyone from turning it on when it is locked with
a padlock.
(9) When adjusting each peripheral device independently, make sure to turn the power off the robot
controller.
(10) Operators must take the gloves off while manipulating the operator’s panel or teach pendant.
Operation with gloved fingers may cause an operation error.
(11) Programs, system variables, and other information can be saved on memory card or USB memories.
Be sure to save the data periodically in case the data is lost in an accident. (Refer to Controller
maintenance manual.)
(12) The robot must be transported and installed by accurate procedure recommended by FANUC.
Wrong transportation or installation may cause the robot to fall, resulting in severe injury to
workers.
(13) In the first operation of the robot after installation, the operation should be restricted to low speeds.
Then, the speed should be gradually increased to check the operation of the robot.
(14) Before the robot is started, it should be checked that no one is in the area of the safety fence. At the
same time, a check must be made to ensure that there is no risk of hazardous situations. If detected,
such a situation should be eliminated before the operation.

Safety of the Collaborative Worker
A collaborative workers indicates the personnel who work with collaborative robot, and if necessary,
perform the start operation of the program with operator button for collaborative worker. Because they
may contact with the collaborative robot, they must periodically be trained about its danger and securing
safety method at emergency.
2.4.4
Safety of the Operator
An “ Operator ” indicates a person who turns on and off the power to the robot system, and starts a robot
the program with operator’s panel (in a daily operation.). Prohibit operators from working inside the
safety fence.
(1) If you don’t need to operate the robot, turn the power off the robot controller, or press the
“ EMERGENCY STOP ” button, and then proceed your work.
(2) Install a safety fence with a safety gate to prevent any worker other than the operator from entering
the work area unexpectedly and the worker from entering a hazardous area.
(3) Install one or more necessary quantity of EMERGENCY STOP button(s) within the operator’s reach
in appropriate location(s) based on the system layout.
The robot controller is designed to be connected to an external EMERGENCY STOP button.  With this
connection, the controller stops the robot operation (Please refer to "STOP TYPE OF ROBOT" in SAFETY
PRECAUTIONS for detail of stop type), when the external EMERGENCY STOP button is pressed.  See the

2.4.5
Safety of the Programmer
While teaching the robot, the operator must enter the work area of the robot. Especially the teach pendant
operator must secure own safety.
(1) Unless it is specifically necessary to enter the robot work area, carry out all tasks outside the area.
(2) Before teaching the robot, check that the robot and its peripheral devices are all in the normal
condition.
(3) If it is inevitable to enter the robot work area to teach the robot, check the locations, settings, and
other conditions of the safety devices (such as the EMERGENCY STOP button, the Enabling device
(DEADMAN switch) on the teach pendant) before entering the area.
(4) The programmer must be extremely careful not to let anyone else enter the robot work area.
(5) Programming must be done outside of the safety fence as far as possible. If programming needs to be
done in the area of the safety fence, the programmer must take the following precautions:
-
Before entering the safety fence area, ensure that there is no risk of hazardous situation in the
area.
-
Be ready to press the emergency stop button whenever it is necessary.
-
Operate the Robot at low speed.
-
Before starting programming, check the entire system status to ensure that no remote
instruction to the peripheral equipment or motion would harm working person .
(6) Operator must work under the condition of Contact Stop function activates.
(7) Required to deactivate the Contact Stop temporally, take measure to disseminate Contact Stop
function deactivates.
Our operator panel is provided with an emergency stop button and a key switch (mode switch) for selecting the
automatic operation mode (AUTO) and the teach modes (T1 and T2).  Before entering the inside of the safety
fence for the purpose of teaching, set the switch to a teach mode, remove the key from the mode switch to prevent
other people from changing the operation mode carelessly, then open the safety gate.  If the safety gate is opened
with the automatic operation mode set, the robot stops (Please refer to "STOP TYPE OF ROBOT" in SAFETY
PRECAUTIONS for detail of stop type).  After the switch is set to a teach mode, the safety gate is disabled.  The
programmer should understand that the safety gate is disabled and is responsible for keeping other people from
entering the inside of the safety fence.
Our teach pendant is provided with an enabling device(DEADMAN switch) as well as an emergency stop button.
These button and switch function as follows:
(1) Emergency stop button:  Causes the stop of the robot (Please refer to "STOP TYPE OF ROBOT" in SAFETY
PRECAUTIONS for detail of stop type) when pressed.
(2) Enabling device(DEADMAN switch) :  Functions differently depending on the teach pendant enable/disable
switch setting status.
(a) Enable:   Servo power is turned off when the operator releases the enabling device (DEADMAN switch) or
when the operator presses the switch strongly.
(b) Disable:   The enabling device (DEADMAN switch) is disabled.
Note) The DEADMAN switch is provided to stop the robot when the operator releases the teach pendant or
presses the pendant strongly in case of emergency.  The R-30 i B employs a 3-position enabling device
(DEADMAN switch), which allows the robot to operate when the 3-position enabling device (DEADMAN
switch) is pressed to its intermediate point.  When the operator releases the enabling device
(DEADMAN switch) or presses the switch strongly, the robot stops immediately.
The programmer intention of starting teaching is determined by the controller through the dual operation of setting
the teach pendant enable/disable switch to the enable position and pressing the enabling device (DEADMAN
switch). The programmer should make sure that the robot could operate in such conditions and be responsible in
carrying out tasks safely.
Based on the risk assessment by FANUC, number of operation of enabling device (DEADMAN switch) should not
exceed about 10000 times per year.

ROBOT SYSTEM DESIGN
In this chapter, requirements for robot system design are described.
-
Placement of Equipment
-
Power Supply and Protective Earth Connection
-
Other Precautions
In addition, the basic requirements for end effector, workpiece, and peripheral equipment are outlined in
3.5 in SAFETY PRECAUTIONS. The characteristic of collaborative robot are outlined in 3.6 in
SAFETY PRECAUTIONS.
About the safety fence, safety gate and other protection devices, refer to Section 4.5 to 4.7 in SAFETY
PRECAUTIONS.
Collaborative robot applications are different from traditional robot systems because of the capability of
the robot to operate in close proximity to a person in the robot’s operating space without an enabling
device. Guidance in ISO 10218-2 (ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012) should be followed in the construction of the
robot system using collaborative robots.
In ISO10218-2, carrying out risk assessment (a dangerous evaluation) for the whole robot system is
demanded. Depending on a result of the risk assessment (a dangerous evaluation), please carry out
appropriate safe protection plan to reduce the risk that a person injures.
3.1
GENERAL
The robot system must be designed, constructed, and implemented so that in case of a foreseeable failure
of any single component, whether electrical, electronic, mechanical, pneumatic, or hydraulic, safety
functions are not affected or when they are, the robot system is left in a safe condition (“Failure to
safety”).
Under the intended conditions of use, the discomfort, fatigue and psychological stress faced by the
operator must be reduced to the minimum possible, taking into account ergonomic principles such as:
-
allowing for the variability of the collaborative worker and operator’s physical dimensions, strength
and stamina,
-
providing enough space for movements of the parts of the collaborative worker and operator’s body,
-
avoiding a machine-determined work rate,
-
avoiding monitoring that requires lengthy concentration,
-
adapting the man/machinery interface to the foreseeable characteristics of the collaborative worker
and operators.
ISO10218-2 requires performing risk assessment for the whole robot system. The application of the
electrical equipment of the robot system must be accordance with IEC/ EN60204-1
or
NFPA70/NFPA79.

A warning device must be such that the operator and people in dangerous area can easily recognize
it.
•
For UL standard compliance, “a yellow or amber visual indicator” specified by CL 36.1 of UL 1740
was to be installed by the end-user or system manufacturer.  SYSRDY or PROGRUN output
signals are available for installing such a visual indicator.
•
The area must be appropriately lighted, especially for maintenance and inspection.
The lighting must not create a new dangerous situation (e.g. dazzled).
CAUTION
Operation inside of the safety fence (teaching, maintenance, etc.) without
suitable ambient lighting can cause hazards of collision (with some obstacles
inside of the safety fence) or slipping/falling down of personnel.
•
It is recommended that adjustment, greasing or oiling, and other maintenance work can be performed
from outside the dangerous area while the system is stopping.
If it is not feasible, a method to perform these operations safely must be established.
•
If the robot and the peripheral equipment synchronously move in the robot system, an appropriate
measure must be provided to avoid unsafe condition by stopping the entire system in the event any
of the equipment stops due to malfunction.
•
Any robot that can be controlled from a remote location must be provided with an effective means
that must prevent hazardous conditions of the robot being initiated from any other location.
•
It is recognized that for certain phases of the robot system life (e.g. commissioning, process
changeover, cleaning, and maintenance) it may not be possible to design completely adequate
safeguards to protect against every hazard or that contain safeguards may be suspended.
Under these conditions, appropriate safe working procedures must be used.

•
Adopt limit switches or mechanical stoppers to limit the robot motion, and avoid the robot from
collisions against peripheral devices or tools.
•
Observe the following precautions about the mechanical unit cables. Failure to follow precautions
may cause mechanical troubles.
-
Use mechanical unit cable that have required user interface.
-
Do not add user cable or hose to inside of mechanical unit.
-
Please do not obstruct the movement of the mechanical unit cable when cables are added to
outside of mechanical unit.
-
In the case of the model that a cable is exposed, Please do not perform remodeling (Adding a
protective cover and fix an outside cable more) obstructing the behavior of the outcrop of the
cable.
-
When installing user peripheral equipment on the robot mechanical unit, please pay attention
that equipment does not interfere with the robot itself.
•
The frequent power-off stop for the robot during operation causes the trouble of the robot. Please
avoid the system construction that power-off stop would be operated routinely. (Refer to bad case
example.)  Please execute power-off stop after reducing the speed of the robot and stopping it by
hold stop or cycle stop when it is not urgent. (Please refer to "STOP TYPE OF ROBOT" in
SAFETY PRECAUTIONS for detail of stop type.)
(Bad case example)
-
Whenever poor product is generated, a line stops by emergency stop and power-off of the robot
is executed.
-
When alteration was necessary, safety switch is operated by opening safety fence and
power-off stop is executed for the robot during operation.
-
An operator pushes the emergency stop button frequently, and a line stops.
-
An area sensor or a mat switch connected to safety signal operates routinely and power-off stop
is executed for the robot.
-
Power-off stop is regularly incurred due to an inappropriate setting for Dual Check Safety
(DCS).
•
Power-off stop of Robot is executed when collision detection alarm (SRVO-050) etc. occurs. Please
try to avoid unnecessary power-off stops. It may cause the trouble of the robot, too. So remove the
causes of the alarm.
•
Operating the robot in the jog mode, set it at an appropriate speed so that the operator can manage
the robot in any eventuality.

END EFFECTOR, WORKPIECE AND PERIPHERAL
EQUIPMENT
It is the responsibility of the robot system manufacturer to perform the risk assessment of the end effector,
workpiece and peripheral equipment.
This section outlines the basic requirement for the risk assessment of these components.
End Effector
•
End effectors must be designed and constructed, or safeguarded, so that
-
power failure does not cause release of the load(workpiece) or result in a hazardous condition.
-
The static and dynamic forces created by the load(workpiece) and the end effector together are
within the load capacity and dynamic response of the robot.
-
Shape or motion of the end effector does not harm the personnel.
•
We recommend to protect the hard part with sponges, and relax the force when the personnel contact
it.
•
If it is equipped with a tool that can function with several different conditions (speed, etc.), the
selection of the condition must be safely and securely done.
Workpiece
•
The material and its shape must not be dangerous and if unsafe, safety measures must be provided.
•
If the workpiece is in extreme high or low temperature, safety measures must be provided to avoid
personnel from touching or getting too close to it.
WARNING
Dropping workpiece or any material may result in personal injury.
Peripheral Equipment (including end effector)
•
The material and shape must not be dangerous.
•
If any component could break down during operation, it must be placed so that it will not scatter if it
breaks down.
•
Pipes (for liquid/gas) must have enough strength for its internal / external pressure.
•
Pipes must be secured and protected from the external pressure or tension.
•
Be sure to provide measures to avoid a dangerous situation if a pipe is broken causing sudden
movement of the pipe or the high speed flow of material.
•
If a pneumatic device is used, be sure to install an air valve which shuts off the air supply to the
robot.
•
If a power source other than the electricity (e.g. pneumatic, water, heat) is used in the system, be
sure to perform appropriate risk-assessment, and be sure to provide appropriate safety measures.

3.6
THE CHARACTERISTIC OF COLLABORATIVE ROBOT
AND LIMITATIONS AND USAGE NOTES
This section describes that the characteristic of collaborative robot and limitations and usage notes.
Refer to Collaborative Robot Function OPERATOR’S MANUAL (B-83744EN) about the detail of each
function.
CONTACT STOP FUNCTION
•
When the external force exceeds the external force limit, the robot stops. Example, when a person
contacts to robot and big external force add to robot, the robot stops. This function does not
guarantee safety in the all situation. The notice must be followed and additional appropriate
safeguarding measures must be placed as the need arises.
※ External force ： Force to act on the robot at the time of contact by the robot motion.
•
The external force is calculated by the torque acting on each axis. Therefore, when the robot contacts
at the point near the each axis, the robot may not stop even if the external force is more than the
external force limit. On the other hand, when the robot contacts at the point far from the each axis,
the robot may stop even if the external force is smaller than the external force limit.
•
A default value of external force limit is 150N. The sensitivity of contact stop can be increased by
decreasing the external force limit. But in case of increasing sensitivity, the robot may stop by
misdetecting the contact depending on the motion of the robot. The external force limit can’t
increase more than 150N.
•
There is a function which resume the program automatically after contact stop. If this function is
effective, Even if the robot stops, program is restarted automatically when required condition is met.

### Page 23

B-84194EN/01
SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
s-21
WARNING
Motion groups other than Collaborative robot are outside of the scope of the
contact stop function. If a person comes into contact with the motion group other
than Collaborative robot, a serious personal injury could result. If the robot
system is designed to include the motion group other than Collaborative robot,
adequate risk assessment for the whole robot system is necessary to verify that
the motion group other than Collaborative robot are outside of the scope of the
contact stop function.
ACCEPTABLE MOTION SPEED FOR BODY REGIONS
•
Be sure to set motion speed in order to prevent injury caused by the force of contact to a sensitive
area as determined by the risk assessment. Please note that a default value of collaborative motion
speed is 250mm/s, and the maximum setting value is 1000mm/s. For reference, acceptable motion
speed for body regions are shown below.
Acceptable motion speed for body regions
Body region
Acceptable motion speed (mm/s)
Face, Neck
Not applicable
Arm, Hand, Fingers
1000
Thigh, knee
250
Lower legs
Not applicable
Body region excluding the above region
300
RESTART AFTER CONTACT STOP
•
Restart by the switch installed near the robot is possible. In that case, be sure to install the
emergency stop button near the restart switch.
PUSH TO ESCAPE
•
When a person pushes the robot, the robot escapes. Only J1 axis, J2 axis and J3 axis can respectively
escape by pushing. The robot stops after certain distance escape. In this case, release your hand for a
moment and push again. When the robot escapes, the attitude of TCP changes.
RETREAT AFTER CONTACT STOP
•
When the robot was stopped by the contact stop and if strong force to robot remains, the robot will
retreat slightly.
NOTE TO DESIGN THE COLLABORATIVE WORKSPACE
When the designer of a robot application system design the workspace where person work near robot, the
designer must follow the following notes.
WARNING
When person is pinched between the robot and the other object (wall, floor, etc.),
and the robot arm, it may result in personal injury.
•
The space where a person escapes at contacting to robot must be placed between collaborative
workspace and wall, floor, etc. If the space can’t be placed, the robot system must be designed to use
additional appropriate safeguarding measures. Example, when a person access to dangerous space,
the robot stops.
•
The following countermeasure is effective as a measure to reduce the generation force when
pinching between the robot and the other object.
-
Reduce the robot's motion speed near the place where pinching is occurred.

### Page 24

SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
B-84194EN/01
s-22
-
Cover the object or the table with a soft material because the lower the rigidity of the contact
point, the smaller the generated force.
•
Untrained (according to Subsection 2.4.1) people must not enter collaborative workspace.
•
The ambient working space in which people may collide with the collaborative robot shall be
arranged so they can move safely.
WARNING
Inappropriate collaborative workspace may result in personal injury.
WORKING NOTE INSIDE THE COLLABORATIVE WORKSPACE
•
Please don't put any objects on the robot. Foreign objects may cause an improper detection of the
external contact seen by the robot.
•
When people enter the collaborative workspace, please take care of their safety using the personal
protective equipment (helmet, safety shoes, protective glasses etc.), as the need arises.
INDICATION OF COLLABORATION MODE
•
The visual indication, for example lamp, indicating that the robot is in collaborative operation is
necessary. The LED installed on the robot is set for this purpose. The LED color differs depending
on the robot status according to the following table.

PROTECT OF HEAD, NECK
WARNING
An impact force to the head or neck from contact with the robot may cause death
or heavy injury of the users.
•
The robot system must be designed not to contact robot to head or neck of person with frequency.
WARNING
If a part of body is pinched, it might cause heavy injury.
•
When wrist unit or J3 arm approaches J1 base or J2 base, a part of your body may be pinched.
EXTERNAL FORCE AGAINST THE ROBOT
•
If force generated from the end effector, force of pushing direction or pulling direction generated
from the cables and hoses connected to the end effector exceeds the restriction value of the external
force   Design a system during considering to avoid force mentioned above is applied to the robot.
For information of the external force and load monitoring method, refer to Subsection 4.2.2
“Payload Monitor” of the OPERATOR’S MANUAL (Collaborative Robot Function) (B-83744EN).
HIGH SPEED MODE
•
By default, the speed of the collaborative robot is limited by 1000mm/s. but robot can move with
over this speed. If operating robot with 1000m/s or more, risk assessment for traditional robot
(no-collaborative) is required and additional appropriate safeguarding measures is required as the
need arises. The basic safeguarding measures is safeguarding fence, but other safeguarding measures
that is result of risk assessment may be admitted.
•

SAFETY DEVICES
4.1
STOP TYPE OF ROBOT
There are following three types of Stop Category.
Stop Category 0 following IEC 60204-1 (Power-off Stop)
Servo power is turned off, and the robot stops immediately. Servo power is turned off when the robot is
moving, and the motion path of the deceleration is uncontrolled.
“ Stop Category 0 ” performs following processing.
•
An alarm is generated, and then the servo power turns off. Instantly the robot stops.
•
Execution of the program is paused.
Frequent Category 0 Stop of the robot during operation can cause mechanical problems of the robot.
Avoid system designs that require routine or frequent Category 0 Stop conditions.
Stop Category 1 following IEC 60204-1 (Controlled Stop, Smooth Stop)
The robot is decelerated until it stops, and servo power is turned off.
“ Stop Category 1 ” performs following processing.
•
The alarm " SRVO-199 Controlled stop " or " SRVO-289 Smooth Stop " occurs along with a
decelerated stop. The program execution is paused.
•
An alarm is generated, and then the servo power turns off.
In Smooth stop, the robot decelerates until it stops with the deceleration time shorter than Controlled stop.
The stop type of Stop Category 1 is different according to the robot model or option configuration. Please
refer to the operator's manual of a particular robot model.
Stop Category 2 following IEC 60204-1 (Hold)
The robot is decelerated until it stops, and servo power remains on.
“ Stop Category 2 ” performs following processing.
•
The robot operation is decelerated until it stops. Execution of the program is paused.

SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
s-25
WARNING
1 The stopping distance and time of Stop Category 1 are longer than those of Stop
Category 0. A risk assessment for the whole robot system which takes into
consideration the increased stopping distance and stopping time is necessary
when Stop Category 1 is used. Please refer to the operator's manual of a
particular robot model for the data of stopping distance and time.
2 In multi arm system, the longest stopping distance and time of Stop Category 1
among each robot are adopted as those for the system. A risk assessment for
the whole robot system which takes into consideration a possibility that the
stopping distance and time increase, is necessary on the multi arm system.
3 In the system which has extended axis, the longer stopping distance and time of
Stop Category 1 among robot and extended axis are adopted as those for the
system. A risk assessment for the whole robot system which takes into
consideration a possibility that the stopping distance and time increase, is
necessary on the system which has extended axis. Please refer to the extended
axis setup procedure of the controller operator’s manual for considering the
stopping distance and time of the extended axis.
4 When Stop Category 1 occurs during deceleration by Stop Category 2, the stop
type of robot is changed to Stop Category 0.
5 In case of Stop Category 1, motor power shutdown is delayed for a maximum of
2 seconds. In this case, a risk assessment for the whole robot system is
necessary, including the 2 seconds delay.
When the emergency stop button is pressed or the FENCE is open, the stop type of robot is Stop Category

4.5
SAFEGUARDS
The safeguards consists of:
•
safety fence (fixed guard),
•
safety gate (with interlocking devices),
•
safety plug and socket, and
•
other protection devices.
These safety devices must be complied with EN ISO, IEC and so on In addition, system designers must
install these devices according to the risk assessment.
This section describes the basic requirements for these devices. Please refer to EN ISO 10218 and so on
for detail. Note that these safety devices must be fitted to the robot system by the system house, etc.
WARNING
Suitable safety guards are installed around robot system as the need arises.
Robot operation without safety guards required from the result of risk
assessment can cause serious injury or death of personnel.
4.5.1
Safety Fence
The basic requirements for Safety Fence are as follows.
•
The fence is constructed to withstand foreseeable operational and environmental forces.
•
The fence is free of sharp edges and projection and is not themselves a hazard.
•
The fence prevents access to the safeguarded space except through openings associated with
interlocking devices.
•
The fence is permanently fixed in position and is removable only with the aid of tools.
•
Fixing system of the safety fence must remain attached to the safety fence or to the robot system
when they are removed.
•
Where possible, safety fence must be incapable of remaining in place without their fixings.
•
The fence cause minimum obstruction to the view of the production process. (wire mesh, lattice,
panel etc.)
•
The fence is located at an adequate distance from the maximum space.

### Page 31

B-84194EN/01
SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
s-29
•
The fence should be connected to PE (protective Earth) to prevent the electric shock with accident.
•
Please refer to the following and their related standards for detail of safety fence aperture size,
minimum size of grids and so on.
-
EN ISO 13855
-
EN ISO 13857
-
ANSI B11.19
4.5.2
Safety Gate and Plugs
The basic requirements for Safety Gate are as follows.
•
The gate prevents the robot system from automatic operation until the gate is closed.
•
The closure of the gate is not the control to restart automatic operation. This must be a deliberate
action at a control station.
•
The gate has plug and socket for interlock. The plug and socket must be selected appropriate things
for safety.
This gate must be the one either it remains locked closed until the risk of injury from the hazard has
passed (interlocking guard with guard locking) or opening the guard while the robot system is working
gives a stop or emergency stop instruction (interlocking guard).
Please refer to EN ISO 14119 or ANSI B11.19 for detail of interlocking system.
If a personnel whole body can enter the safeguard space via the interlocking door, installing a device that
the door does not close without intending.
Care should be taken to ensure that actuation of an interlock installed to protect against on hazard (e.g.
stopping hazardous motion of the robot system) does not create a different hazard (e.g. the release of
hazardous substances into the work zone).
4.5.3
Other Protection Devices
Protection devices must be designed and incorporated into the control system so that:
•
they can be adjusted only by means of an intentional action, such as the use of a tool, key, etc.,
•
the absence or failure of one of their components prevents starting or stops the moving parts.
As the need arises, the robot system must be designed so that
•
moving parts cannot start up while they are within the operator’s reach,
•
the exposed person cannot reach moving parts once they have started up.
If some presence sensing devices are used for safety purposes, they must comply with the following.
•
A presence sensing device must be installed and arranged so that persons cannot enter and reach into
a hazardous area without activating the device.
•
A presence sensing device must be installed and arranged so that persons cannot reach the restricted
space before the hazardous conditions have ceased.
•
Barriers used in conjunction with the presence-sensing device may be required to prevent persons
from bypassing the device.
•
Their operation must not be adversely affected by any of the environmental conditions for which the
system was intended.
•
When a presence-sensing device has been activated, it may be possible to restart the robot system
from the stopped position provided that this does not create other hazards.
•
As the need arises, resumption of robot motion must require the removal of the sensing field
interruption. The result of risk assessment may require that this must not be the control to restart
automatic operation.

4.6
OPERATION INSIDE OF THE SAFETY FENCE
When some workers (programmer, maintenance engineer) have to enter the safety fence, the following
care has to be taken into account.
•
Make sure that the robot system has been completely stopped before entering the safety fence. Never
enter the safety fence during the robot moving. If the robot is moving, stop the robot by hold button
(or input signal), and after "controlled stop" it (servo power off), then you can enter the safety fence.
(In case a safety fence is installed.)
•
Make sure that an indicator lamp for stop condition (to be suitably installed by the end user) shows
the stopped status of the robot, and enter the safety fence from the safety gate.
•
To inform you are working in the safety fence, display “working”. During robot teaching or test
operation, robot may move to an unexpected direction. So exercise special care, and perform
teaching in the position where you can escape from the robot in case of dangerous situation.
•
Set "Safe speed" signal enabled.
•
When more than one worker collaborates for their operation, a user in charge should be equipped
with teach pendant, and other users have to follow his order.
Any operations from the external interface and robot controller operation panel without his order
have to be prohibited.
•
All users inside of the safety fence always have to secure the escape zone to avoid hazards from
unintended movement of the robot.
•
Care should be taken by all workers not to close off the escape routes for each other.
•
Do not operate the robot resting against the wall, apparatus installed inside of the safety fence, etc.
those take away escape zone from the operator.
•
Keep watching the robot during operation in jogging, program verification, etc.
•
Stop the robot immediately by E-stop SW when somebody recognizes dangerous situation.
Whenever possible, other user who is readily accessible to the E-stop SW keeps watch from the
outside of the safety fence.
•
Make sure that deadman switches on teach pendant are operated only by hand.
•
Make sure that nobody still exists inside of the safety fence when the safety gate is going to be
closed.
•
Do not leave tools etc. inside of the operating space of robot or peripheral devices, when operation
inside of the safety fence has been finished.
WARNING
1 Safety procedures of entering the safety fence have to be established and
observed. Improper procedure of entering the safety fence can cause serious
injury or death of personnel who enter the safety fence.

the robot operating space and neighborhood. When it is necessary to perform programming with
personnel inside the safeguarded space, the following safety procedures are necessary.
WARNING
No other personnel than programmer or teaching operator enter inside of safety
fence during teaching. Unauthorized entry to inside of safety fence can cause
serious injury or death of personnel who enter the safety fence.
5.3.1
Prior to Programming
The following conditions must be met before making taught program.
•
The programmer must be trained on the type of robot used in the actual robot system and must be
familiar with the recommended programming procedures including all of the safeguarding methods.
•
The programmer must visually check the robot system and safeguarded space to ensure that
extraneous conditions which can cause hazardous do not exist.
•
When using the teach pendant to make taught program, the teach pendant must be tested to ensure
proper operation.
•
Any faults or failures of the robot system must be corrected prior to teaching the robot.
•
Before entering the safeguarded space or robot operating space and neighborhood, the programmer
must ensure that all necessary safeguards are in place and functioning.
•
The programmer must set the operating mode to taught mode prior to entering the safeguarded space
or robot operating space and neighborhood. Take measure to prevent the third person starting auto

s-36
5.3.4
Other Cautions for Programming
•
Adopt a limit switch or other sensor to detect a dangerous state and, if necessary, design the program
to stop the robot when the sensor signal is received.
•
Design the program to stop the robot when an abnormal condition occurs in any other robots or
peripheral devices, even though the robot itself is normal.
•
For a system in which the robot and its peripheral devices are in synchronous motion, particular care
must be taken in programming in order not to interfere with each other.
•
Provide a suitable interface between the robot and its peripheral devices so that the robot can detect
the states of all devices in the system, and can be stopped according to the states.
•
Design to arrange avoiding mutual interfere when various robot’s operation space crossover
significantly.
•
Be sure to specify the predetermined work origin in a motion program so that the robot starts from
the origin and terminates at the origin. Make it possible for the operator to distinguish easily that the
robot motion has terminated at a glance.
•
Circumspect program with sufficient delay required for the program after executing some control
command in adopting actuators (pneumatic, hydraulic, and electric)
•
Adopt limit switches for the end effector, and control the robot system by monitoring the state.
5.4
PROGRAM VERIFICATION
When visual examination of the robot system response to the task program is necessary as part of the
verification procedure, it should be made with all persons outside the safeguarded space and its
neighborhood. When it is necessary to perform program verification with personnel inside the
safeguarded space or the robot operating space and neighborhood, apply the following contents.
•
Program verification must initially be performed at reduced speed.
Special care is required when override is specified in the program.

ZERO POINT POSITION AND MOTION LIMIT
Zero point and motion range are provided for each controlled axis. Exceeding the software motion limit
of a controlled axis is called overtravel (OT). Overtravel is detected at both ends of the motion limit for
each axis. The robot cannot exceed the motion range unless there is a loss of zero point position due to
abnormalities in servo system or system error.
Fig.3.3 (a) to (h) show the zero point, and motion limit of each axis.
*
The motion range can be changed.  For information on how to change the motion range, see

LOAD SETTING
WARNING
If the load setting is wrong, safety function may lost , and it may cause injury of
the personnel. If the load setting is changed, confirm the value and perform the
test again.
CAUTION
1 Perform load setting (payload, payload center and inertia) correctly. If load
setting is not correct, the sensitivity of the contact stop may getting worse. In
addition, collaborative robot always check the load is correct or not during
operations. If the robot detect the actual load does not match the load setting,
robot stops for safety. So if load setting is incorrect, you cannot operate the
robot.
2 Set the correct load condition parameter before the robot runs. Do not operate
the robot in over when its payload is exceeded or incorrect. Do not exceed the
allowable payload including connection cables and its swing. Operation in with
the robot over payload may result in troubles such as reducer life reduction.
The operation motion performance screens include the MOTION PERFORMANCE screen, MOTION
PAYLOAD SET screen, and payload information and equipment information on the robot.

PIPING AND WIRING TO THE END
EFFECTOR
WARNING
•  Only use appropriately-specified mechanical unit cables.
•  Do not add user cables or hoses inside of the mechanical unit.
•  Please do not obstruct the movement of the mechanical unit cable when cables
are added to outside of mechanical unit.
•  Please do not perform remodeling (adding a protective cover, or secure an
additional outside cable) that obstructs the behavior of the outcrop of the cable.
•  When external equipment is installed in the robot, make sure that it does not
interfere with other parts of the robot.
•  Cut and discard any unnecessary length of wire strand of the end effector (hand)
cable. Insulate the cable with seal tape. (See Fig. 5 (a))
•  If you have end effector wiring and a process that develops static electricity,
keep the end effector wiring as far away from the process as possible.  If the
end effector and process must remain close, be sure to insulate the cable.
•  Be sure to seal the connectors of the user cable and terminal parts of all cables
to prevent water from entering the mechanical unit. Also, attach the cover to the
unused connector.
•  Frequently check that connectors are tight and cable jackets are not damaged.
•  When precautions are not followed, damage to cables might occur. Cable failure
may result in incorrect function of end effector, robot faults, or damage to robot
electrical hardware. In addition, electric shock could occur when touching the
power cables.

6. AXIS LIMIT SETUP

AXIS LIMIT SETUP
By setting the motion range of each axes, you can change the robot’s motion range from the standard
values. Changing the motion range of the robot is effective under following circumstances:
•
Used motion range of the robot is limited.
•
There’s an area where tool and peripheral devices interfere with robot.
•
The length of cables and hoses attached for application is limited.
WARNING
1 Changing the motion range of any axis affects the operating range of the robot.
To avoid trouble, carefully consider the possible effect of the change to the
movable range of each axis in advance. Otherwise, it is likely that an unexpected
condition will occur; for example, an alarm may occur when the robot tries to
reach a previously taught position.
2 Use the DCS function so that damage to peripheral equipment and injuries to
human bodies can be avoided.
6.1
CHANGE AXIS LIMIT BY DCS
The robot motion can be restricted with DCS (Dual check safety) function. The robot motion can be
restricted at any angle and position if it is in robot motion area.   DCS functions are certified to meet the
requirements of International Standard ISO13849-1 and IEC61508 approved by notified body. If only the
operating space is set using Joint Position Check, the robot stops after it goes beyond the workspace.
When the motor power is shut down, the robot’s momentum causes it to move some distance before it
completely stops. The actual "Robot Stop Position" will be beyond the workspace. To stop the robot
within the robot workspace, use the DCS Stop Position Prediction function. The stop position prediction
is disabled by default.
As an example, we shows the procedure to set  ± 30 º  for J2-axis in here.   Refer to Dual check safety
function Operator’s Manual (B-83184EN) for details of other setting, function and DCS stop position
prediction.

CHECKS AND MAINTENANCE
Optimum performance of the robot can be maintained by performing the periodic maintenance procedures
presented in this chapter.   (See APPENDIX A PERIODIC MAINTENANCE TABLE.)
NOTE
The periodic maintenance procedures described in this chapter assume that the
FANUC robot is used for up to 3840 hours a year. In cases where robot use
exceeds 3840 hours/year, adjust the given maintenance frequencies
accordingly. The ratio of actual operation time/year vs. the 3840 hours/year
should be used to calculate the new (higher) frequencies. For example, when
using the robot 7680 hours a year with a recommended maintenance interval of
3 years or 11520 hours, use the following calculation to determine the
maintenance frequency: 3 years / 2 = perform maintenance every 1.5 years.

MASTERING
Mastering associates the angle of each robot axis with the pulse count value supplied from the absolute
Pulsecoder connected to the corresponding axis motor. To be specific, mastering is an operation for
obtaining the pulse count value; corresponding to the zero position.
8.1
OVERVIEW
The current position of the robot is determined according to the pulse count value supplied from the
Pulsecoder on each axis.
Mastering is factory-performed. It is unnecessary to perform mastering in daily operations. However,
mastering is required under the following conditions:
x
Motor replacement.
x
Pulsecoder replacement
x
Reducer replacement
x
Cable replacement
x
Batteries for pulse count backup in the mechanical unit have gone dead
CAUTION
Robot data (including mastering data) and Pulsecoder data are backed up by
their respective backup batteries. Data will be lost if the batteries die. Replace
the batteries in the controller and mechanical units periodically. An alarm will
alert you when battery voltage is low.
Types of Mastering
There are following mastering methods.
Table 8.1 (a) Type of mastering
Fixture position
mastering
Mastering performed with the mastering fixture.
Zero-position mastering
(witness mark mastering)
Mastering which performed with all axes set at the 0-degree position. A zero-position
mark (witness mark) is attached to each robot axis. This mastering is performed with
all axes aligned to their respective witness marks.
Quick mastering
This is performed at a user-specified position. The corresponding count value is
obtained from the rotation count of the Pulsecoder connected to the relevant motor and
the rotation angle within one rotation. Quick mastering uses the fact that the absolute
value of a rotation angle within one rotation will not be lost. (All axes at the same time)
Quick mastering
for single axis
This is performed at a user-specified position for one axis. The corresponding count
value is obtained from the rotation count of the Pulsecoder connected to the relevant
motor and the rotation angle within one rotation. Quick mastering uses the fact that the
absolute value of a rotation angle within one rotation will not be lost.
Single axis mastering
Mastering which performed for one axis at a time. The mastering position for each axis
can be specified by the user. Useful in performing mastering on a specific axis.
Mastering data entry
Enter the Mastering data directly.
This section describes zero-position mastering, quick mastering, quick mastering for single axis,
single-axis mastering, and mastering data entry. For more detailed mastering (fixture position mastering),
contact your local FANUC representative.

VERIFYING MASTERING
1
How to verify that the robot is mastered properly:
Usually, positioning is performed automatically when the power is turned on. To check whether
mastering has been performed correctly, examine if the current displayed position meets the actual
robot position by using the procedure described below:
(1) Reproduce a particular point in a program. Check whether the point agrees with the specified
position.
(2) Set all axes of the robot to their 0-degree (0 rad) positions. Check that the zero-degree position
marks indicated in Section 8.3 of OPERATOR’S MANUAL are aligned. There is no need to
use a visual aid.
If the displayed and actual positions do not match, the counter value for a Pulsecoder may have been
invalidated as a result of an alarm described in 2. Alternatively, the mastering data in system
variable $DMR_GRP.$MASTER_COUN may have been overwritten as a result of an operation
error or some other reason.
Compare the data with the values indicated on the supplied data sheet. This system variable is
overwritten whenever mastering is performed. Whenever mastering is performed, record the value of
the system variable on the data sheet.
2
Alarm type displayed during mastering and their solution method:
(1) BZAL alarm
This alarm is displayed if the Pulsecoder's backup battery voltage decreases to 0 V while the
power to the controller is disconnected. Furthermore, if the Pulsecoder connector is removed
for cable replacement, etc. this alarm is displayed as the voltage decreases to 0. Confirm if the
alarm will disappear by performing a pulse reset (See Section 8.2.). Then, cycle power of the
controller to check if the alarm disappears or not.
The battery may be drained if the alarm is still displayed. Perform a pulse reset, and turn off
and on the controller power after replacing the battery. Note that, if this alarm is displayed, all
the original data held by the Pulsecoder will be lost. Mastering is required.
(2) BLAL alarm
This alarm is displayed if the voltage of the Pulsecoder's backup battery has fallen to a level
where backup is no longer possible. If this alarm is displayed, replace the battery with a new
one immediately while keeping the power turned on. Check whether the current position data is
valid, using the procedure described in 1.
(3) Alarm notification like CKAL, RCAL, PHAL, CSAL, DTERR, CRCERR, STBERR, and
SPHAL may have trouble with Pulsecoder, contact your local FANUC representative.

TROUBLESHOOTING
The source of mechanical unit problems may be difficult to locate because of overlapping causes. Problems
may become further complicated, if they are not corrected properly. Therefore, you must keep an accurate
record of problems and take proper corrective actions.
9.1
TROUBLESHOOTING
Table 9.1 (a) shows the major troubleshooting that may occur in the mechanical unit and their probable
causes. If you cannot pinpoint a failure cause or which measures to take, contact your local FANUC
representative.
Table 9.1 (a) TROUBLESHOOTING
Symptom
Description
Cause
Measure
-
The J1 base lifts off the
base plate as the robot
operates.
-
There is a gap between the
J1 base and base plate.
-
A J1 base retaining bolt is
loose.
[J1 base fastening]
-
It is likely that the robot J1
base is not securely
fastened to the base plate.
-
Probable causes are a
loose bolt, an insufficient
degree of surface flatness,
or foreign material caught
between the base plate and
floor plate.
-
If the robot is not securely
fastened to the floor plate,
the J1 base lift from the
ground. Thus may cause
the collision, and lead to
vibration.
-
If a bolt is loose, apply
LOCTITE and tighten it with
the appropriate torque.
-
Adjust the base plate
surface flatness to within
the specified tolerance.
-
If there is any foreign
material between the J1
base and base plate,
eliminate them.
-
Apply adhesive between
the J1 base and base plate.
-
The rack or floor plate
vibrates during operation of
the robot.
[Rack or floor]
-
It is likely that the rack or
floor is not rigid enough.
-
If they are not rigid enough,
counterforce deforms the
rack or floor, and
responsible for the
vibration.
-
Reinforce the rack or floor
to make it more rigid.
-
If reinforcing the rack or
floor is impossible, modify
the robot control program;
doing so will reduce the
vibration.
Vibration
Noise
-
Vibration becomes more
serious when the robot is in
a specific posture.
-
If the operating speed of
the robot is reduced,
vibration stops.
-
Vibration is most noticeable
when the robot is
accelerating.
-
Vibration occurs when two
or more axes operate at the
same time.
[Overload]
-
It is likely that the load on
the robot is heavier than
the maximum rating.
-
It is likely that the robot
control program is too
demanding for the robot
hardware.
-
It is likely that the
ACCELERATION value is
excessive.
-
Check the maximum load
that the robot can handle or
not. If the robot is
overloaded, reduce the
load, or modify the robot
control program.
-
Vibration can be reduced
by re-modifying the robot
control program; reducing
speed or acceleration with
minimizing the influence on
the entire cycle time.

Symptom
Description
Cause
Measure
Vibration
Noise
(Continued)
-
Vibration was first noticed
after the robot collided with
an object or the robot was
overloaded for a long
period.
-
Periodic vibration and noise
occur.
[Gear, bearing, or reducer]
-
It is likely that collision or
overload applied an
excessive force on the
drive mechanism, thus
damaging the tooth surface
or rolling contact surface of
a bearing, or reducer.
-
It is likely that prolonged
use of the robot while
overloaded caused fretting
of the tooth surface or
rolling contact surface of a
bearing, or reducer due to
resulting metal fatigue.
-
It is likely that foreign
matter caught in a gear,
bearing, or within a reducer
caused damage on the
tooth surface or rolling
contact surface of the
bearing, or reducer.
-
It is likely that foreign
matter caught in a gear,
bearing, or within a reducer
cause vibration.
-
Operate one axis at a time
to determine which axis is
vibrating.
-
Remove the motor, and
replace the gear, the
bearing, and the reducer.
For the spec. of parts and
the method of replacement,
contact FANUC.
-
Using the robot within its
maximum rating prevents
problems with the drive
mechanism.
-
There is some relationship
between the vibration of the
robot and the operation of a
machine near the robot.
[Noise from a nearby machine]
-
If the robot is not grounded
properly, electrical noise is
induced on the grounding
wire, preventing commands
from being transferred
accurately, thus leading to
vibration.
-
If the robot is grounded at
an unsuitable point, its
grounding potential
becomes unstable, and
noise is likely to be induced
on the grounding line, thus
leading to vibration.
-
Connect the grounding wire
firmly to ensure a reliable
ground potential and
prevent extraneous
electrical noise.

(Continued)
-
The cause of problem
cannot be identified from
examination of the floor,
rack, or mechanical unit.
[Controller, cable, and motor]
-
If a failure occurs in a
controller circuit,
preventing control
commands from being
supplied to the motor
normally, or preventing
motor information from
being sent to the controller
normally, vibration might
occur.
-
Pulsecoder defect may be
the cause of the vibration
as the motor cannot
propagate the accurate
position to the controller.
-
If the motor becomes
defective, vibration might
occur because the motor
cannot deliver its rated
performance.
-
If a power line in a movable
cable of the mechanical
unit has an intermittent
break, vibration might
occur because the motor
cannot accurately respond
to commands.
-
If a Pulsecoder wire in a
movable part of the
mechanical unit has an
intermittent break, vibration
might occur because
commands cannot be sent
to the motor accurately.
-
If a connection cable
between the mechanical
unit and the controller has
an intermittent break,
vibration might occur.
-
If the power supply cable is
about to be snapped,
vibration might occur.
-
If the power source voltage
drops below the rating,
vibration might occur.
-
It may vibrate when the
invalid value parameter
was set.
-
Refer to the Controller
Maintenance Manual for
troubleshooting related to
the controller and amplifier.
-
Replace the motor of the
axis that is vibrating, and
check whether vibration still
occurs. To replace the
motor, Contact your local
FANUC representative.
-
If vibration occurs only
when the robot assumes a
specific posture, it is likely
that a cable in the
mechanical unit is broken.
-
Check whether the jacket of
the cable connecting the
mechanical unit and
controller is damaged. If so,
replace the connection
cable, and check whether
vibration still occurs.
-
Check whether the jacket of
the power cable is
damaged. If so, replace the
power cable, and check
whether vibration still
occurs.
-
Check that the robot is
supplied with the rated
voltage.
-
Check that the robot control
parameter is set to a valid
value. If it is set to an invalid
value, correct them.
Contact your local FANUC
representative for further
information if necessary.
Rattling
-
While the robot is not
supplied with power,
pushing it with the hand
causes tottering part of the
mechanical unit.
-
There is a gap on the
mounting face of the
mechanical unit.
[Mechanical unit coupling bolt]
-
It is likely that overloading
or a collision has loosened
a mounting bolt in the robot
mechanical unit.
-
Check the following
retaining bolts tightness for
each axis. If any of these
bolts is loose, apply
LOCTITE and bolt down
with appropriate torque.

Symptom
Description
Cause
Measure
-
The ambient temperature
of the installation location
increases, causing the
motor to overheat.
-
After the robot control
program or the load was
changed, the motor
overheated.
[Ambient temperature]
-
It is likely that a rise in the
ambient temperature
prevented the motor from
releasing heat efficiently,
thus leading to
overheating.
[Operating condition]
-
It is likely that the robot was
operated with the maximum
average current exceeded.
-
The teach pendant can be
used to monitor the
average current. Check the
average current when the
robot control program is
running. The allowable
average current is specified
for the robot according to
its ambient temperature.
Contact FANUC for further
information.
-
Relaxing the robot control
program and conditions
can reduce the average
current, thus preventing
overheating.
-
Reducing the ambient
temperature is the most
effective means of
preventing overheating.
-
Having the surroundings of
the motor well ventilated
enables the motor to
release heat efficiently,
thus preventing
overheating. Using a fan to
direct air at the motor is
also effective.
-
If there is a source of heat
near the motor, it is
advisable to install
shielding to protect the
motor from heat radiation.
Motor
overheating
-
After a robot control
parameter (load setting
etc.) was changed, the
motor overheated.
[Parameter]
-
If data input for a workpiece
is invalid, the robot cannot
be accelerate or decelerate
normally, so the average
current increases, leading
to the motor overheating.
-
As for load setting, Input an
appropriate parameter
referring to Section 4.2 of
the operator’s manual.
-
Symptom other than stated
above
[Mechanical unit problems]
-
It is likely that problems
occurred in the mechanical
unit drive mechanism, thus
placing an excessive load
on the motor.
[Motor problems]
-
It is likely that motor brake
failure locked on the break,
and cause the motor
overloaded.
-
It is likely that a failure of
the motor prevented it from
delivering its rated
performance, thus causing
an excessive current to flow
into the motor.
-
Repair the mechanical unit
referring to the above
descriptions of vibration,
noise, and rattling.
-
Check that, when the servo
system is energized, the
brake is released.
If the brake remains applied
to the motor all the time,
replace the motor.
-
Judgment is possible if the
average current decreased
after replacing the motor,
the former motor had been
defected.

Oil leakage
-
Grease or oil is leaking
from the mechanical unit.
[Poor sealing]
-
Probable causes are a
crack in the casting, a
broken O-ring, a damaged
oil seal, or a loose seal bolt.
-
A crack in a casting can
occur due to excessive
force that might be caused
in collision.
-
An O-ring can be damaged
if it is trapped or cut during
disassembling or
re-assembling.
-
An oil seal might be
damaged if extraneous
dust scratches the lip of the
oil seal.
-
If a crack develops in the
casting, sealant can be
used as a quick-fix to
prevent further grease or oil
leakage. However, the
component should be
replaced as soon as
possible, because the
crack might extend.

-
An axis falls in standstill.
[Brake drive relay and motor]
-
It is likely that brake drive
relay contacts are stuck to
each other and keep the
brake current flowing, thus
preventing the brake from
operating when the motor is
reenergized.
-
It is likely that the brake
shoe has worn out or the
brake main body is
damaged, preventing the
brake from operating
efficiently.
-
It is likely that oil or grease
soak through the motor,
causing the brake to slip.
-
Check whether the brake
drive relay contacts stuck

MOUNTING BOLT TORQUE LIST
NOTE
When applying LOCTITE to a part, spread the LOCTITE on the entire length of the
engaging part of the female thread. If applied to the male threads, poor adhesion
can occur potentially loosening the bolt. Clean the bolts and the threaded holes
and wipe off the oil on the engaging section. Make sure that there is no solvent left
in the threaded holes. In this case, remove all the excess LOCTITE when you are
finished screwing the bolts into the threaded holes.
Use the following strength bolts. Comply with  any bolt specification instructions as specified.
Hexagon socket head bolt made of steel:
Size M22 or less:
Tensile strength 1200N/mm 2   or more
Size M24 or more:
Tensile strength 1000N/mm 2   or more
All size plating bolt:
Tensile strength 1000N/mm 2   or more
Hexagon bolt, stainless bolt, special shape bolt (button bolt, low-head bolt, flush bolt .etc.)
Tensile strength 400N/mm 2   or more
Refer to the following tables if the bolts tightening torque are not specified.
